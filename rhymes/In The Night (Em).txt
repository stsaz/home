In The Night
by Simon Zolin, Aug 2015

[I]
Em
When the night comes down
C
You look back at your past.
Em                          C            D
Your regrets so strong you can't fall asleep.
Again you've let yourself down,
You wish this day was your last,
There's nothing you can change, so you lie and weep
All the night.

[II]
As time's passing you learn:
Your vow became your curse,
And all your strength, and all your health you exhaust.
There's nothing in return:
              D
The life you live is not yours,
You are not who you are, you feel so damn lost
In the night.

[III]
You take in your sails,
Everywhere you roam
You cease steering, you just float with a stream.
Every try fails
To pass through the storm -
The anger grows with the sound of your scream
Into the night.

[iv]
You dig into sand
Your spirit and your soul,
Afraid to stand up and rise to your height.
Reigning in your own land,
You're shut behind your wall.
The fence you built blocks your way to the light.

Nothing for tomorrow
You have made,
The memories you follow
Are going to fade
Into the night,
Fade into the night.
