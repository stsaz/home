Wanted List
by Simon Zolin, 2018

[I]
"Dead or alive", the papers say.
Price for my head is what they pay.
Even though the hounds always follow,
They can never stand on my way.

[R]
Another murder,
The bullets fly through morning mist.
I'm going further
To the top of wanted list,
Wanted list.

[II]
Countless collisions with the law
Don't make me stop and just lay low.
Nothing ever will suppress my hunger -
Hunger for killing more and more.

[r2]
There is no other -
I strike as lightning with my gun.
Don't even bother
To try and test me one-on-one.

[R]

[III]
See those horsemen on my trail,
Following me to put in jail.
Here I stand alone against the justice.
No matter what I must prevail.

[r3]
My gun is loaded,
Four shots - four bodies lay in dust.
Their dreams are all dead.
Nobody has the hand as fast.

[R]
