The Final Shout
by Simon Zolin, 2013, Jul 2014

[I]
Caught within my net
Now you are mine.
I'm inside your head,
I rule your mind.
Bow and give away
Your destiny.
All your power
Now belongs to me.

[BRG]
Give the strength from your rage,
Let it all flow to me.
Tear your voice to the edge,
That's what I need.

[R]
Scream - the hopeless sound,
No one's around.
You're breathing out
Your final shout.

[II]
I love how you weep,
Let you not rest.
I laugh as you keep
Fighting my grasp.
Can't escape me - I
Block all your tries.
Watch the dying
Hope in your eyes.

[BRG]
[R]

[VAR]
Feel the time,
Its heavy weight,
Crushing you,
Breaking your fate.

To the core
You feed my lust,
Leaving none
But sand and dust.

Don't deny
And face the truth:
I'm sucking out
All your youth.

[III]
Flame within your heart
Is burning out.
Now, before you start
Screaming so loud,
Feel the emptiness
That sets you free,
Ends your nightmare,
Your misery.

[BRG]
[R]
