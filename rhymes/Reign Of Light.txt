Reign Of Light

[I]
All with beginning
Ends with time.
When the Sun will burn it -
Earth will die.

No way to fight it,
No need to hide,
Life is finished -
Burned on site.

[BRG]
You're gonna face your God -
A billion years your guard.
As it was your prime -
It will stop your time.

[R]
Reign of light
Brings your death.
Reign of light.

[II]
Rays keep firing
To atmosphere.
Holes keep growing,
Now the path is clear.

All your oceans -
Fog in the air.
Where once was forest
Now is despair.

[BRG]

[VAR]
Solar wind
Penetrates your body
To destroy,
To explode your core.

The time is up,
Stop your hopeless fighting.
To the void -
As you were before.

[III]
Heat from the surface
Of the giant star
Melts the remainings
Left so far.

Strong radiation
Straight from the Sun
Burns all to ashes.
Earth is done.

[BRG]
[R]
