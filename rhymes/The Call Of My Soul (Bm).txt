The Call Of My Soul
by Simon Zolin, Jul 2015

[I]
Bm                               G
Since I was born my hands were chained like a slave.
A                             Bm
The concrete walls can never make me feel safe.
My lips are sewn so I can't speak for myself.
Restrained by all those rules I'm like a convict in a cell.

G
But...
[R]
         A         Bm
I wanna feel I'm alive,
To live a free fair life.
G     A
Fly away -
Em      Bm
Find a way.
G            A          Bm
Is this the call of my soul?
Fly away -
Just find a way.
Is this the call of my soul?

Yeah...
[II]
I was scared to step away from the groove,
Afraid to look into the eyes of the truth.
I watch the sky, looking up through the bars,
Ooh, how I want out, I wanna fly to the stars!

[BRG]
My dream again
Is calling my name,
Screaming inside:
"Let me out!"

[R]
...
I hear the call of my soul!

[VAR]
Am
Now the call
           Em
Is loud as ever it was before.
         F
It's my time to go,
             Dm         Em
I can't suppress it anymore!
I won't let
My past decide my future way,
And there's no regret
To escape from here today!

Yeah!
[R]
...
I follow the call of my soul.
