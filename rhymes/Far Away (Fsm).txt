Far Away

[I]
F#m           E
I'm forever alone,
        D             E           F#m  E
But in you I found a reason to go on.
And what more can I do -
Through the space my light will travel to reach you.

[BRG]
D      E              F#m
And I wish we were together,
D     E             D
Only we're so far away,
  C#7
Away.

So,
                             E
If a ray of light is like a word,
                               D
Will the sound of my voice be heard?
                               C#7
I would yell if only you were near:
"Look! I'm right here!".
And I wish that you could see me now
Through the billion other stars somehow,
But I feel that we will always stay
         F#m
So far away,
      E
Far away,
  F#m
So
      E  D  E
Far away.

[II]
Years, so many have passed,
Now I realize our friendship will not last.
Fire, that's burning inside,
Will decay until there's nothing left on site.

[BRG]
We can never be together,
You will never find a way,
Way.

 F#m
Bound,
E              F#m
I am spinning round,
     C#m             D
The darkness's all around.
   E             D             E
How long will I keep keep on dreaming?

And though
There's not much left to go,
The wind of change will blow,
The Universe will keep keep on beaming

     D
The light
                 E                   F#m
That gives me strength against this night...
            E  D  E
...mare to fight.
