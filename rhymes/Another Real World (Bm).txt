Another Real World

[I]
Bm                    A
He exists in his own world
                     Bm
Free of any joy and pain.
He can't feel he's growing old,
Lies and truth - all the same.
Darkness is his only friend
'til his coming end.

[R]
G     A             Bm
Going on to live a lie,
He can't see he's not alive.
All in black, his look is cold -
He's in another real world.

[II]
The sands of time are running out -
Soon his spirit will be free.
The voice inside loudly shouts
But there's nothing we can hear.
Locked within his past -
There he's gonna last!

[R]

[VAR]
G           A                Bm
With every gasp he's leaving us
But no one's here to see the loss.
The hope to wake up at the dawn
Creates the reason to go on.

[R]
...
He is in another real world.
He is in
Another world.
