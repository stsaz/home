Take Away The Sun

Em G D C D

[I]
Em             G
I'm trying to hide
D                            C D
From the sun that blinds my mind.
Shining is wide,
There's no place that I can find.

Em
Give me darkness
G
Back in my nest
D                        C D
Where I was so warm and safe.
Is this my fate?
Can't it just wait?
I'm not ready, I'm not brave.

[R]
D             C
But I wanna stay!
D              Em       G
Can't you all wait any longer?
Coming next day
                                  D
I'll be a little bit stronger to run.
                C     D       Em
But now please take away the sun!

[II]
The day has come,
And everything has turned to white.
The sun's become
Into a blasting, killing light.

The sun is burning,
While this morning
Is crushing me away from here.
The day is dawning,
And now I'm learning:
It's giving what I see and hear.

[VAR]
C                D        Em  C D
It doesn't even leave any ashes.
Everywhere there are fire flashes.
D
Oh

Em      C
The pain is so big
D       Em
And I become so weak
C          D               Em
And now into this world I dive, Woah,
C                 D            Em
To bear the huge weight of my life.

[R]
