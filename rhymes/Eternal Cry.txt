Eternal Cry
by Simon Zolin, Sep 2011

[I]
Fire as the sky,
Ash as the ground -
They will never see again a sunny day.
Mountains of bones,
Rivers of blood -
It's the perfect place for all their sins to pay.
No way to get out,
No way to survive -
It's new home for them now, it's their new life.

[R]
Let them enter the darkness
Far below the sky,
Let them fall into nowhere,
Let them hear eternal cry,
Voices of eternal cry.

[II]
Hole underground -
Cage for the soul -
Holds them all chained to their fate they can't control.
Now it's their time:
The bells start to toll,
The redemption for the past begins to draw.
Hear as they shout,
Each single voice,
Heads explode of all the noise.

[R]

[VAR]
Lost within the fears,
Never they feel safe.
Cry bitter tears,
Chained in a cave.
Death, the end is here.
Coal is their grave.

[III]
A new day has come,
Again they're awake -
And it's going round and round with no relief.
Burning forever
Nailed to the stake.
There is no one to return them their belief.

[R]
