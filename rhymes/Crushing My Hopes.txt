Crushing My Hopes
by Simon Zolin, Jul 2012

[I]
I'm the one who holds his ground,
After the voice of spirit I found.
I will try 'til I die,
But you never knew, you'll never know why.

You believe I will fall,
Telling me to be quiet and stay low.
All that you see you avoid,
Now look at yourself: your life is a void.

[R]
You belong to those who fail,
I'm the kind who prevail.
Stop crushing my hopes!

[II]
So, you believed that I lied
About my strength, all you denied.
Now I reached my full height.
But you weren't there, you'll never know how.

I've heard enough that I'm wrong.
The less you talk, the more I grow strong.
You pretended to care,
But the trust you broke is not to repair.

[R]

[VAR]
Now it's my turn to be evil,
That's enough for me to cry.
Time to wake, unleash the demon.
I stand here and watch you die.

Now when you have no tomorrow,
Look: you've nothing ever had.
And there's no more time to borrow.
Feel regrets for all you've said.

[R]
