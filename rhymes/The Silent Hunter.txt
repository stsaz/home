The Silent Hunter
by Simon Zolin, Sep 2011, Jul 2015

[I]
Hunting's a game I love
Playing on this land.
You're victim I am af...ter,
I can smell your scent.
Go, lead yourself astray,
Run into the night.
I always reach my prey,
Let God be my guide.

[BRG]
Fear is crawling deep
Into your mind, into you.
I'm getting nearer
I will find you!

[R]
I am the silent hunter,
I'm here to take you in hell!
Your soul's going under.
Burn there well!

[II]
I'm gonna raise my bow,
Free the burning arrow.
Fire through the dark will glow,
Fill your mind with terror.
Stop struggling for your life,
Hoping to evade.
Your punishment arrives,
Just accept your fate.

[BRG]
[R]

[VAR]
Oh-oh, I'm on your trace.
Oh-oh, you'll never win this deadly race!
I sense your spirit's getting weak.
Get ready for one final rush
Before I force your voice to hush.

[III]
Arrow with metal head
Thrusts into your flesh.
All dreams within your head
Shatter in a flash.
Read all my plans on you
On my silent grin.
My venom's going through -
You're paralyzed within.

[BRG]
[R]
