Miley Cyrus - When I Look At You (D#m->F#m)

[I]
F#m            A
Everybody needs inspiration
E          D
Everybody needs a song
A beautiful melody
When the night's so long
C#m                 D
'Cause there is no guarantee
A               E
That this life is easy

[R]
           A            E
Yeah, when my world is falling apart
              F#m          D
When there's no light to break up the dark
That's when I, I
I look at you
When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you

[II]
When I look at you, I see forgiveness
I see the truth
You love me for who I am
Like the stars hold the moon
Right there where they belong
And I know I'm not alone

[R]

[VAR]
A      D    E            F#m
You appear just like a dream to me
Just like kaleidoscope colors that
E         D
Cover me, all I need
E             F#m
Every breath that I breathe
E             D         E
Don't you know you're beautiful?

[R]
...
...Yeah, yeah, yeah
When the waves are flooding the shore
And I can't find my way home anymore
That's when I, I
I look at you
I look at you
Yeah, yeah, oh

[outro]
     A     D    E            D
And you appear just like a dream to me
