Scorpions - Living for Tomorrow (Em->F#m)

[INTRO]
           F#m          D
I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today

[I]
F#m
Let's make this world
   E               F#m D
A better place to live
         F#m E
Stop to take
          F#m  E
Start to give

Love's got the power
To get it done
To stop the pain
Of a killing gun

[BRG]
    A            B
And even if you say
    D            E
We're gonna die today

[R]
           F#m          D
I'm still living for tomorrow
     F#m          D
I'm living for today
        F#m              E
'Cause love will find a way my friend
    D             E
Whatever it will take

I'm still living for tomorrow
I'm living for today
Why don't we try today my friend
To make this world a better place

[II]
Let's make this life
A better life to live
Stop to hate
Learn to forgive

Evil power can kill
The human race
If we give life
A human face (a human face)

(brg)

(r)
A better place!

(brg)

(r)
I'm still living for tomorrow
