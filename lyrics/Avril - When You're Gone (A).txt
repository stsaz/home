Avril Lavigne - When You're Gone (G->A)

A F#m E

[I]
  A              C#m        F#m
I always needed time on my own
                D
I never thought I'd
                        E
Need you there when I cry
And the days feel like years when I'm alone
And the bed where you lie
Is made up on your side

[BRG]
      Bm
When you walk away
              A
I count the steps that you take
        C#m                           E
Do you see how much I need you right now?

[R]
             A
When you're gone
     F#m           E
The pieces of my heart are missing you
             A
When you're gone
     F#m             E
The face I came to know is missing too
             F#m
When you're gone
             A
The words I need to hear
   C#m                   E     A
To always get me through the day
              E
And make it okay
        A  F#m E
I miss you

[II]
I've never felt this way before
Everything that I do
Reminds me of you
And the clothes you left they lie on the floor
And they smell just like you
I love the things that you do

[BRG]

[R]

           C#m
...I miss you

[VAR]
                      D
We were made for each other
            A
Out here forever
           E
I know we were
 C#m
Yeah, yeah
    F#m
And all I ever wanted was for you to know
A
Everything I do, I give my heart and soul
C#m                              D                  E
I can hardly breathe; I need to feel you here with me
Yeah

[R]
