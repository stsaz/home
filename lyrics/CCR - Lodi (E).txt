Creedence C.R. - Lodi (A#->E)

Just about a year ago,
   A             E
I set out on the road,
            B        C#m
Seekin' my fame and fortune,
 A                   B
Lookin' for a pot of gold.
E           B         C#m
Things got bad, and things got worse,
    A                      E
I guess you will know the tune.
             B           A     E
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again.

[II]
Rode in on the Greyhound,
I'll be walkin' out if I go.
I was just passin' through,
Must be seven months or more.
Ran out of time and money,
Looks like they took my friends.
Oh, Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again.

[III]
The man from the magazine
Said I was on my way.
Somewhere I lost connections,
Ran out of songs to play.
I came into town, a one night stand,
Looks like my plans fell through
Oh, Lord, stuck in Lodi again.

If I only had a dollar,
 B                F#
For ev'ry song I've sung.
           C#         D#m
And ev'ry time I've had to play
       B                 C#
While people sat there drunk.
      F#        C#         D#m
You know, I'd catch the next train
  B               F#
Back to where I live.
                 C#           B     F#
Oh, Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again.
Oh, Lord, I'm stuck in Lodi again.
