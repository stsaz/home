Whitesnake - Blindman (F#m->Bm)

[I]
        Bm
I was dreaming of the past
        A                Bm
Why do good times never last?
Help me Jesus, show the way
I can't hold on another day

I was hungry, feeling low
I just couldn't make out which way to go
Chasing rainbows that have no end
The road is long without a friend

[R]
D        A            Em   A G
Be my friend, be my brother
G       A               Bm
Be the piper, play the call
Across the seven seas of wonder
Be the guardian of my soul
A G Bm
Oh

[II]
Just a young man looking homeward
Watching the sun go down again
Across the water the sun is shining
But will it ever, will it ever be the same?

[R]

[VAR]
I need somebody, I need someone
I need somebody to call my own
Like a blindman, I can feel the heat of the sun
But like a blindman, I don't know, I don't know
I don't know where it's coming from

[R]
