Deep Purple â€“ Soldier Of Fortune (Gm->F#m)

[I]
       F#m
I have often told you stories
  G#m
About the way
   F#m
I lived the life of a drifter
C#m
Waiting for the day
          F#m
When I'd take your hand and sing you songs
      E
Then maybe you would say
 F#m
Come lay with me and love me
    C#m                  C#m B A
And I would surely stay

[R]
A      E                F#m F#m E D
But I feel I'm growing older
         E                 A
And the songs that I have sung
C#7           F#m
Echo in the distance
          E
Like the sound
      A              D
Of a windmill going round
 Bm                C#m
Guess I'll always be
              F#m
A soldier of fortune.

[II]
Many times I've been a traveler
I looked for something new
In days of old when nights were cold
I wandered without you
But those days I thought my eyes
Had seen you standing near
Though blindness is confusing
It shows that you're not here.

[R]
Now...

D               E
I can hear the sound
      A              D
Of a windmill going round
    Bm               C#m
I guess I'll always be
              F#m
A soldier of fortune.

   D                 E
I guess I'll always be
              F#
A soldier of fortune.
