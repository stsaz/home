Avril Lavigne - My Happy Ending (Bm -> C#m)

[INTRO]
C#m   A
Oh oh, oh oh
E               B
So much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh
So much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh...

[I]
                C#m
Let's talk this over
                     A
It's not like we're dead
                    E
Was it something I did?
                      B
Was it something you said?
Don't leave me hanging
In a city so dead
Held up so high
On such a breakable thread

[BRG]
         A                  B
You were all the things I thought I knew
    A                   B
And I thought we could be

[R]
         A                  E           B
You were everything, everything that I wanted
         A                        E         B
We were meant to be, supposed to be but we lost it
                A                     E        B     C#m
And all of the memories, so close to me, just fade away
F#m
All this time you were pretending
 A
So much for my happy ending

Oh oh, oh oh
So much for my happy ending
Oh oh, oh oh
Oh oh...

[II]
You've got your dumb friends
I know what they say
They tell you I'm difficult
But so are they
But they don't know me
Do they even know you?
All the things you hide from me
All the shit that you do

[BRG]

[VAR]
B                                 E
It's nice to know that you were there
                            B
Thanks for acting like you cared
                                  E
And making me feel like I was the only one
B                           C#m
It's nice to know we had it all
                          E
Thanks for watching as I fall
                             B
And letting me know we were done

[R]
He was...
