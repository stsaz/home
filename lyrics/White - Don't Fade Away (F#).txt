Whitesnake - Don't Fade Away (A#->F#)

[I]
F#                   B
As I stand at the crossroad,
           G#m          D#m
I see the sun sinking low
With my cross of indecision,
I can't tell which way to go

Now I have seen the seven wonders
And I have sailed the seven seas,
I've walked and talked with angels,
And danced all night with gypsy queens

[R]
C#                       B
All in all it's been a rocky road,
E           B               F#
Twists and turns along the way
         C#               B
But, I still pray for tomorrow,
        G#m         B
All my hopes, my dreams
             C#                  F#
Don't fade away, don't fade away

[II]
I have painted many portraits,
Memories of love and pain,
Though cut down by life's deceptions
I found the strength to start again

[R]

[VAR]
C#
Heaven help a man
           B           F#
Trying to make up his mind,
C#
With the darkness closing in,
            B              F#
I feel I'm running out of time
C#
Shine a light for me,
         G#m
Help me find the way to go,
     B                               C#      F#
And take me where I've never been before

[III]
And so I stand at the crossroad,
Watching the sun sinking low
With my cross of indecision,
Trying to find the way to go

[R]
