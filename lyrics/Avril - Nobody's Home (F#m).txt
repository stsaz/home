Avril Lavigne - Nobody's Home (Fm->F#m)

[I]
F#m               A
Well I couldn't tell you
         D
Why she felt that way,
                  F#m
She felt it everyday.
And I couldn't help her,
I just watched her make
The same mistakes again.

[BRG]
F#m
What's wrong, what's wrong now?
A
Too many, too many problems.
Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.

[R]
F#m              A                  E
She wants to go home, but nobody's home.
It's where she lies, broken inside.
With no place to go, no place to go
To dry her eyes. Broken inside.

[II]
Open your eyes
And look outside,
Find the reasons why.
You've been rejected,
And now you can't find
What you left behind.

[BRG]
Be strong, be strong now.
Too many, too many problems.
Don't know where she belongs, where she belongs.

[R]

[VAR]
F#m               A
Her feelings she hides.
                      F#m
Her dreams she can't find.
She's losing her mind.
She's fallen behind.
She can't find her place.
She's losing her faith.
She's fallen from grace.
She's all over the place.
Yeah, yeah

F#m           A            F#m
She's lost inside, lost inside...
   A
Oh oh yeah
She's lost inside, lost inside...
Oh oh yeah
