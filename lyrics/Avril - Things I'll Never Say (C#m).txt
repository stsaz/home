Avril Lavigne - Things I'll Never Say (Bm->C#m)

[INTRO]
E B C#m A
La-la...
(x2)

[I]
C#m                A
I'm tugging at my hair
                    E
I'm pulling at my clothes
                       B
I'm trying to keep my cool
            C#m
I know it shows
I'm staring at my feet
My cheeks are turning red
I'm searching for the words inside my head

[BRG]
C#m                       E
'Cause I'm feeling nervous
                        F#m
Trying to be so perfect
F#m                          B
'Cause I know you're worth it
You're worth it yeah

[R]
E                              B
If I could say what I want to say
                           C#m
I'd say I wanna blow you... away
                   A
Be with you every night
                        E
Am I squeezing you too tight
If I could say what I want to see
I want to see you go down
On one knee
Marry me today
                             C#m
Guess, I'm wishing my life away
A
With these things I'll never say

[INTRO]

[II]
It don't do me any good
It's just a waste of time
What use is it to you
What's on my mind
If it ain't coming out
We're not going anywhere
So why can't I just tell you that I care

[BRG]

[R]

[VAR]
C#m       B           F#m
What's wrong with my tongue
       E                     C#m
These words keep slipping away
I stutter, I stumble 
Like I've got nothing to say

[BRG]

[INTRO]

                            C#m
Guess I'm wishing my life away
A                             E
With these things I'll never say

[R]
                         E
These things I'll never say
