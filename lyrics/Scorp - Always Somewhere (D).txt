Scorpions - Always Somewhere (C->D)

D A Em Bm

[I]
D          A          G    F#m   Bm
Arrive at seven the place feels good
D           A          Bm
No time to call you today
Encores till eleven then Chinese food
Back to the hotel again

[II]
I call your number the line ain't free
I like to tell you come to me
A night without you seems like a lost dream
Love I can't tell you how I feel

[R]
D       A
Always somewhere
Bm
Miss you where I've been
G        A                 D   A
I'll be back to love you again
(x2)

[III]
Another morning another place
The only day off is far away
But every city has seen me in the end
And brings me to you again

[R]
