Gorky Park - Two Candles (Em->Bm)

[I]
Bm    F#7       D
Loneliness is my only guest
Am          B7         Em Em D
Who visits me alone at night
C
When it comes I light two candles
Bm
Just the way it was
C#m                                Em F#7
And pretend the flames become your eyes

[II]
Emptiness is a friend I guess
The shadow played upon the wall
If I let the candles take me
I can see your face
And remember hearing someone call your name

[R]
Bm              F#m   G A
My candles are crying oooh
My candles are crying oooh
                    Bm G Em F#m
They're crying for you
They're waiting for you
                 Bm G A Bm G A
I'm waiting for you

[III]
Is it you knocking at my door
Or may be just a ghostly wind
How I wish that you were here
Sitting by my side
And you'll bring me back to life again tonight

(r)
I'm waiting for you
