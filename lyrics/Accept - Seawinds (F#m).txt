Accept - Seawinds (Dm->F#m)

[I]
      F#m             E
In a cold and dark December
      C#m             G#m
As I walked into the rain
A                 E
Stood beside the road
           F#m
All night long

In the gray December morning
I decided to leave my home
Took a train to nowhere
      F#m     E D  E
Far away, far away

[II]
Many thousand miles away
Where the moon took to the stars
Dreamed about the days
Days gone by, days gone by

[R]
        C#m        B            A
In the night, the seawinds are calling
         E       B        A
And the city is far far away
Soon the sea turns to darkness
It is night and the seawinds are calling
E         F#m      E     D  E
Seawinds call, seawinds call

[III]
Ten thousand miles away
Where the moon took to the stars
Dreamed about the days,
Days gone by

I've been told so many stories
Of dreams my friends have made
So there's no illusion
Sail away, sail away

[R]

Seawinds call
