Kelly Clarkson - Already Gone (A)

A E F#m E D Bm

[I]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

Even with our fists held high
It never would have work out right, yeah
We were never meant for do or die

[BRG]
Bm
I didn't want us to burn out, I
Bm                                         A
Didn't come here to hurt you now I can't stop

[R]
I want you to know
That it doesn't matter
Where we take this road
Someone's gotta go

And I want you to know
You couldn't have loved me better
But I want you to move on
So I'm already gone

[II]
Looking at you makes it harder
But I know that you'll find another
That doesn't always make you wanna cry

Started with a perfect kiss then
We could feel the poison set in
Perfect couldn't keep this love alive

[BRG]
You know that I love you, so I
Love you enough to let you go

[R]

[var1]
I'm already gone
I'm already gone
You can't make it feel right
When you know that it's wrong

I'm already gone
Already gone
There's no moving on
So I'm already gone

[var2]
Already gone
Already gone
Already gone, yeah

Already gone
Already gone
Already gone

[III]
Remember all the things we wanted
Now all our memories, they're haunted
We were always meant to say goodbye

[R]
