Whitesnake - Only My Soul (Am->Bm)

[I]
Bm      A               E G F#7
Only my soul, stops me crying
Bm         A          E
Wondering why I feel alone
And only my love keeps me from weeping so bad
Giving me strength to carry on

[R]
D       A                    Bm A
Lead me on through restless waters
G          A            Bm  Bm A G
Walk with me along the way
G         A            Bm
Live the moment and tomorrow
      A  D                A                 Bm  A
For the Lord will take it all on Judgement Day

[II]
Broken dreams lay all around me
Sad eyed children of despair
Whispered voices in the distance
Call me on who knows where

(r)
         G                F#m               Bm
And the Lord will take it all on Judgement Day

[VAR]
Hear me crying out for love
Hear me crying out for love
Never let you know it
I can only show it in my song, oh
Only my soul
(x4)
