E           F#m
Don't bury me
              D
Don't let me down
               A
Don't say it's over
                         E
Cause that would send me under
Underneath the ground
Don't say those words
I wanna live but your words can murder
Only you can send me under, under
F#m
Under

[I]
F#m                         D
I die every time you walk away
                           A
Don't leave me alone with me. See
        E
I'm afraid
Of the darkness and my demons and the voices
Saying nothing's gonna be OK
eeeeaay

[BRG]
                 F#m
I feel it in my heart, soul, mind that I'm losing
 D
You me you're abusing
A                            E
Every reason I have left to live

[R]

[II]
Lost trust 21 grams of soul
All the sanity I ever owned gone
But I'm still breathing
Through the thunder and the fire and the madness
Just to let you shoot me down again
But I'm still breathing

[BRG]
I feel it in my veins, skin, bones that I'm losing
You me you're confusing
Every reason I have left to live

[R]

[VAR]
F#m
Chasing you but you don't look back
 D
Words I threw that I can't take back
 A                                   E
Reaching out but I can't hold on to you, no
(x2)

[R]

Only you can send me under, yeah, under
