Avril Lavigne - I Will Be (G->A)

[I]
A
There's nothing I could say to you
F#m                           E
Nothing I could ever do to make you see
          A        D
What you mean to me
All the pain, the tears I cried
Still you never said goodbye
And now I know how far you'd go

[BRG]
F#m               D
I know I let you down
                     F#m
But it's not like that now
                      D   E   A
This time I'll never let you go

[R]
A       F#m
I will be
              E
All that you want
                  D
And get myself together
                                  A
'Cause you keep me from falling apart
All my life
I'll be with you forever
To get you through the day
And make everything okay

[II]
I thought that I had everything
I didn't know what life could bring
But now I see, honestly
You're the one thing I got right
The only one I let inside
Now I can breathe 'cause you're here with me

[BRG]
And if I let you down
I'll turn it all around
'Cause I will never let you go

[R]

[VAR]
E
'Cause without you I can't sleep
F#m
I'm not gonna ever ever let you leave
       E
You're all I've got, you're all I want
 A
Yeah

And without you, I don't know what I'd do
I could never ever live a day without you
D                                E      A
Here with me, do you see, you're all I need?

And...
[R]

[R]
I will be (I'll be)
...
All my life (my life)
...
